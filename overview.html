                    <p> 
                        "It’s 9:30 P.M. on a Wednesday night and I’m slicing veggies that I’ll even- tually roast for dinner—tonight’s dinner. I don’t meal-prep; precooked meals that you just reheat in the microwave freak me out (leftovers were a large part of my childhood). Instead, I cook a full meal, for myself, every single night.</p>
                    <p> 
                        It sounds intense, and trust me, sometimes the last thing I want to do after a full day of work and working out is come home to make my own dinner, but over the years I’ve realized it’s just what works for me.</p>
                    <p> 
                        A little background: I grew up overweight and unhealthy, and learning to cook healthy meals for myself is a big part of what ultimately helped me lose 70 pounds. My journey toward lasting better health started about halfway through my sophomore year of college. That year, something shifted. I can’t tell you what, exactly; I had exercised and dieted in the past, but it never stuck. This time, however, I think my subconscious just said Enough is enough. I started exercising and making healthier choices at the dining hall (skip the fries, have a side salad), and when I went home that summer, I focused on cooking my own meals.</p>
                    <p> 
                        I’m no master chef, but honestly, simple, healthy cooking isn’t rocket science. I grew up watching my mother chop and fry and bake, so I just applied that knowledge and winged it. That’s not to say it was easy—nine years later and I’m still overcooking my chicken—but it taught me that “I’m just too busy to eat healthy and cook for myself” is not a viable excuse."
